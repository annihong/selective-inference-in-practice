   abstract = {It is often helpful to classify biomarker values into groups of different risk levels to facilitate evaluation of a biological, physiological, or pathological state. Stratification of patients into two risk groups is commonly seen, but there is always need for more than two groups for fine assessment. So far, there are no standard methods or tools to help decide how many cutoff points are optimal. In this study, we developed a comprehensive package that included methods to determine both the optimal number and locations of cutoff points for both survival data and dichotomized outcome. We illustrated workflow of this package with data from 797 patients with cervical cancer. By analyzing several risk factors of cervical cancer such as tumor size, body mass index (BMI), number of lymph nodes involved and depth of stromal invasion, in relation to survival and clinical outcome such as lymph nodal metastasis and lymphovascular invasion, we demonstrated that the best choice for BMI and stromal invasion was two cutoff points and one for the others. This study provided a useful tool to facilitate medical decisions and the analyses on cervical cancer may also be of interest to gynecologists. The package can be freely downloaded.},

   abstract = {Background: The accumulation of data and its accessibility through easier-to-use platforms will allow data scientists and practitioners who are less sophisticated data analysts to get answers by using big data for many purposes in multiple ways. Data scientists working with medical data are aware of the importance of preprocessing, yet in many cases, the potential benefits of using nonlinear transformations is overlooked. Objective: Our aim is to present a semi-automated approach of symmetry-aiming transformations tailored for medical data analysis and its advantages. Methods: We describe 10 commonly encountered data types used in the medical field and the relevant transformations for each data type. Data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative study, Parkinson's disease hospital cohort, and disease-simulating data were used to demonstrate the approach and its benefits. Results: Symmetry-targeted monotone transformations were applied, and the advantages gained in variance, stability, linearity, and clustering are demonstrated. An open source application implementing the described methods was developed. Both linearity of relationships and increase of stability of variability improved after applying proper nonlinear transformation. Clustering simulated nonsymmetric data gave low agreement to the generating clusters (Rand value=0.681), while capturing the original structure after applying nonlinear transformation to symmetry (Rand value=0.986). Conclusions: This work presents the use of nonlinear transformations for medical data and the importance of their semi-automated choice. Using the described approach, the data analyst increases the ability to create simpler, more robust and translational models, thereby facilitating the interpretation and implementation of the analysis by medical practitioners. Applying nonlinear transformations as part of the preprocessing is essential to the quality and interpretability of results.},

   abstract = {The Fourth Edition of Applied Linear Regression provides a thorough update of the basic theory and methodology of linear regression modeling. Demonstrating the practical applications of linear regression analysis techniques, the Fourth Edition uses interesting, real-world exercises and examples. Stressing central concepts such as model building, understanding parameters, assessing fit and reliability, and drawing conclusions, the new edition illustrates how to develop estimation, confidence, and testing procedures primarily through the use of least squares regression. While maintaining the accessible appeal of each previous edition,Applied Linear Regression, Fourth Edition features: Graphical methods stressed in the initial exploratory phase, analysis phase, and summarization phase of an analysis In-depth coverage of parameter estimates in both simple and complex models, transformations, and regression diagnostics Newly added material on topics including testing, ANOVA, and variance assumptions Updated methodology, such as bootstrapping, cross-validation binomial and Poisson regression, and modern model selection methods Applied Linear Regression, Fourth Edition is an excellent textbook for upper-undergraduate and graduate-level students, as well as an appropriate reference guide for practitioners and applied statisticians in engineering, business administration, economics, and the social sciences.},
