1. ### Meeting (Jan 28th 2022)
    ### Pre-meeting notes:
    - submit an abstract for the poster session? JSM 2022? Due Feb 1st
    - use R package to organize data analysis workflow, helps with reproducibility
    - forgot why minimizing RSS does not hurt inference
    - set seed for any random results for reproducibility
    - what should  you expect under global null? it shouldn't be 0.05 right? 
        - look up the calculation of FDR under global null
    -robust variance lead to higher FDR when x_i ~ lnorm but agrees with conventional variance when x_i ~ norm
        - in what situation is robust variance more conservative than conv var?
    - still unclear why the min p procedure did not create problems for the boston data, think through the experiments I did.
